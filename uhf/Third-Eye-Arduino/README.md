# Third-Eye-Arduino

Arduino based third eye or extra vision for blind people have a project which include both hardware and the software work and it helps the person to recognize the object by the help of ultrasonic waves which comes from ultrasonic sensor with a vibration which is generated by the buzzer. This Project is influenced by the Stick which is used by the blind people while walking for long term carry the stick is measure issue for weak people. So, this is the wearable invention for the weak and blind people they donâ€™t need to carrying anything in hand while walking they should only wear our invention and used to get walking easily. The Arduino is a software device which include. coding as a software function and Ultrasonic sensor, buzzer, Battery and more things as a hardware function, Ultrasonic sensor has a work to recognize the object near them and providing the signal via buzzer to the user which help the person to reach properly at their destination. Main Term: Arduino Uno module, Vibration, Ultrasonic sense.
